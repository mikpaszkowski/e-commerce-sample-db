-- COMMENT this triggers are written based on an updated version of a database
--  whose sql scripts for ddl and population are attached to the project (db_population_edaba.sql, db_ddl_edaba.sql)
--  HOWEVER in galera server on my assigned database MPASZKOW these changes are already applied
--  no need to fire them again


-- *****    TRIGGER 1   ******
-- this trigger validate the values of the INSERT statement. At the beginning it logs the information
-- about the insert attempt, then there are performed checks such as:
--      - percent value (<= 100, percent_value = 100% only for events with free gifts) and amount cannot both be smaller or equal 0
--      - discount type and description must by longer than 2 characters
--      - start date cannot be after end date
--      - automatic completition of  modified_at to the current time
